## Auto Plugin

We are committed to creating the smallest, simplest, and most effective plugins using pure JavaScript or CSS

Auto Plugin Open Source Alliance:
﻿
This alliance is a loose alliance, and if you believe that your tool is automated enough, you can add the auto plugin logo([<img style="height:14px;" src="https://auto-plugin.github.io/dependens/ico.svg">`Auto-Plugin 开源联盟`](https://github.com/Auto-Plugin)) in Readme.md. Before that, you need to receive an invitation or recognition from the auto plugin organization.

 
If you wish to join this alliance, you can send an application email to this email address:`larryzhu@foxmail.com`. The auto plugin organization will conduct a simple evaluation of your plugin, and whether it passes or not, you will receive a clear reply
﻿
﻿
> So when you see this label in the self description file of an open source software, it indicates that the software has passed the review of this alliance, and it will be very easy to use
